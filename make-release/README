Handy-dandy tool to pull a tagged release out of Git and generate:

* a tarball
* a patch to previous revision
* GPG signatures for the above

You will first need to `pip install git-archive-all` (maybe with pip3)

usage: makerelease2.py [-h] [--previous PREVIOUS] [--sign]
                       [--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--upload-tar UPLOAD_TAR]
                       repository tag

positional arguments:
  repository            Path to the MediaWiki git repository
  tag                   Git tag (or branch) to archive

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --previous PREVIOUS   Previous tarball to create a patch against
  --sign                Sign the generated contents with GPG
  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Location to put tarballs, relative to current
                        directory
  --upload-tar UPLOAD_TAR
                        Tarfile to put generated tarballs into

Example:
After you have created (and signed!) the git tag in your git repo, you can run a command like:

`makerelease2.py --sign --upload-tar /tmp/upload.tar --previous 1.27.4 /path/to/mediawiki/core 1.27.5`

This is will make a release for the 1.27.5 tag in the repo at `/path/to/mediawiki/core`, create
patches to the previous release 1.27.4 and generate signature files for all the created files.
It will then put all the generated files in `/tmp/upload.tar` in a folder called `1.27`. You can
reuse this tar to put numerous different MediaWiki releases for upload to the releases server.
